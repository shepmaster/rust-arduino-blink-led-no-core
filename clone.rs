//! The `Clone` trait for types that cannot be 'implicitly copied'
//!
//! In Rust, some simple types are "implicitly copyable" and when you
//! assign them or pass them as arguments, the receiver will get a copy,
//! leaving the original value in place. These types do not require
//! allocation to copy and do not have finalizers (i.e. they do not
//! contain owned boxes or implement `Drop`), so the compiler considers
//! them cheap and safe to copy. For other types copies must be made
//! explicitly, by convention implementing the `Clone` trait and calling
//! the `clone` method.

/// A common trait for cloning an object.
///
/// This trait can be used with `#[derive]`.

    /// Returns a copy of the value.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```
    /// let hello = "Hello"; // &str implements Clone
    ///
    /// assert_eq!("Hello", hello.clone());
